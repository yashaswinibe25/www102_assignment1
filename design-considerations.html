<h1>About My website(Sushi Nami Royale)</h1>
<ul>
  <li> Audience -the statistics of our expected visitors are age ranging from age 10 to old aged people and who are tech-savvy enough to know how to use the Internet.However since i have displayed phone no at the top of the home page it is easy for the audience to make orders or reservations easily online.Geopgraphy ranges till Halifax since we are located at may locations in Halifax.</li>
<li>Layout: Column - I used a 2-3 column layouts in some pages according to the requirements.</li>
<li>Layout: Fluid/Fixed width -I have used a fluid width design and tried to make it respnsive.</li>


<li>Colour choices - I used 2 primary colours(#2A2424,#CDA97D) and 4 secondary colours (#BB173D,#22B84A,#254E1E and #2C1A56). I used cream color background because it looks clean and simple. I used other secondary colours because I wanted to distingush between the contents of the body and headers of the page.</li>

<li>Font choices: I used four three fonts - one for the body content headers,one for the content of the paragraph (webfont),one for the main header.This way, it distinguishes between the contents.</li>

<li>Menu - I placed my navigation menu in the top with position-fixed.
 <p>Reason for doing is at any point of time anywhere in the page audience can easily switch between navigation tabs.Also they can get Sushi's phone no easily.</p>
  <h3>Issues faced while designing my webpage</h3>
   
   <p>
      When i designed navigation bars for my header and tried to resize my browser window, all my nav's tried to overlap(stacked) on each other.</p>
      <h4>How did i fix this issue?</h4>
        <p>
          I used media-queries at the end of my css code to solve this issue. I gave a certain height and a margin to my header and navigations at a certain breakpoints in order to make it responsive and not to overlap on each other.</p>
  </li> 
         
<li>Other -I tried to make liitle animations on the banner image(Sliding texts on banner images).
   </li>       
 </ul>
